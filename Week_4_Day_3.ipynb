        "1. **What Is a Hash?**\n",
        "   - A **hash** is a unique code generated from a piece of information (like a password). It looks like a random string of letters and numbers. Hashing is used to store passwords securely without keeping the actual password.\n",
        "   - Example: If your password is `\"password123\"`, its SHA-1 hash would look something like:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     CBFDAC6008F9CAB4083784CBD1874F76618D2A97\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why Use Only the First 5 Characters of the Hash?**\n",
        "   - Instead of sending the entire hash to the API, we only send the **first 5 characters** (called the **prefix**). This method helps protect your password because the full hash is never shared.\n",
        "   - The remaining characters (called the **suffix**) are kept private and checked locally on your computer. This approach is known as **k-anonymity** and helps ensure your data privacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **How Does the Password Check Work?**\n",
        "   - We split the hash into two parts:\n",
        "     - **Prefix**: The first 5 characters, which are sent to the API.\n",
        "     - **Suffix**: The remaining characters, kept locally for checking.\n",
        "   - The API responds with a list of possible hash matches that start with the prefix.\n",
        "   - We then compare the suffix locally to see if the full hash matches any in the list. This way, we can determine if a password is compromised without revealing it.\n"

        "In this activity, you will build a simple Python script to check if a password has been compromised using the **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) Pwned Passwords API**. This will help you understand how to use API requests and learn about basic cybersecurity practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### üìù **Instructions**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understand the Scenario**:\n",
        "   - You work on the cybersecurity team, and your task is to help users ensure their passwords are safe.\n",
        "   - You‚Äôll create a script that takes a password as input, checks if it has been compromised in a known data breach, and alerts the user if they should change it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exercise steps**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 1: Import Libraries**  \n",
        "     Start by importing the necessary Python libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     import hashlib\n",
        "     import requests\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 2: Get User Input**  \n",
        "     Prompt the user to enter a password to check if it‚Äôs been compromised.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     password = input(\"Enter a password to check if it has been compromised: \")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 3: Hash the Password Using SHA-1**  \n",
        "     Use the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to generate a hash of the password. This helps keep the password secure during the check.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     sha1_hash = hashlib.sha1(password.encode()).hexdigest().upper()\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 4: Prepare the API Request**  \n",
        "     Split the hash into a **prefix** (first 5 characters) and a **suffix** (remaining characters). This allows you to use the k-anonymity model to protect the full password hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     hash_prefix = sha1_hash[:5]\n",
        "     hash_suffix = sha1_hash[5:]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 5: Make the API Request**  \n",
        "     Use the HIBP API to check if the hash prefix appears in the breached passwords database.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     url = f\"https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{hash_prefix}\"\n",
        "     response = requests.get(url)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 6: Check the API Response**  \n",
        "     Ensure the request was successful. If not, print an error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if response.status_code != 200:\n",
        "         print(f\"Error: Unable to connect to HIBP API (Status Code: {response.status_code})\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 7: Parse the Response**  \n",
        "     The API returns a list of hash suffixes and the number of times each was found. Check if the hash suffix of your password is in the returned list.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     hashes = (line.split(':') for line in response.text.splitlines())\n",
        "     found = any(suffix == hash_suffix for suffix, count in hashes)\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Step 8: Display the Result**  \n",
        "     If the hash suffix is found, alert the user that their password has been compromised. Otherwise, inform them that it‚Äôs safe.\n",
        "\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     if found:\n",
        "         print(\"‚ö†Ô∏è This password has been compromised! Choose a different one.\")\n",
        "     else:\n",
        "         print(\"‚úÖ This password is safe and not found in the compromised list.\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Testing Your Script**:\n",
        "   - Try running the script with sample passwords like `\"password123\"`, `\"qwerty2023\"`, or `\"securepass1\"`.\n",
        "   - Observe the output and determine if the password was found in the breached dataset."
